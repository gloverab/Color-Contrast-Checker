# Color-Contrast-Checker

## About
This is a simple and straightforward foreground/background color contrast checker built as a tool for graphic designers. Ratio checking complies with the stated [WCAG 2.0 rules](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG/).

Currently available for use [right here](https://gloverab.github.io/Color-Contrast-Checker/).

## Usage
Input a color value to the foreground and background fields to check the color ratio. You can also use the dropdown color picker by clicking on either swatch and adjusting the sliders to your liking. Once the color ratio is higher than 7.1:1, all of the checks should appear green and you can be on your merry way.

The fields accept hex, rgb, html color, or any color format you could possibly think of. Once the slider is adjusted they will automatically output hex.
